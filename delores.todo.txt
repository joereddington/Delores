# The parser process. 


## The log file 
  * Should have a specalised file extension 
  * With shortcuts for that file - effectively a version of todo.txt but with more going on. 
  * so we can tick and whatever
  * And highlight 


## Questions to answer 
* Do we mark off 'if' checks we've done? If the object is to boost ticks then that's fine. 

## Key 

âœ“ done 
- ignore
3 done three times 
* Needs to be changed, don't count. 

For each day, count the terms. 
## 07/07/22 10:31 to 12:53, Let's have some Delores code.  +EQT
* I've checked out a new branch 
* The lines show colours based on a string 
* Key presses all work. 
* Scores work! 
* Cookies work! 
* Also had a couple of phone calls - one with prison and one with remote.
* Comited, need to test before doing more  

# Project stack 
* Cookies. 
  * Multiple pages, multiple days. 
* A count for loops 
* Redo the design. 
* Full reset button. 
* Sound effect for yeses 
* Timers (and key to update)  
* Yes and No should work differently on "IF" and "While" statements and indeed, shouldn't count as scored. 
* Extract the javascript files. 
* Work out why it doesn't work with subpages
* Work out why the yellow 'cursor' isn't consistent between pages
