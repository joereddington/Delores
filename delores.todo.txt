# The parser process. 


## The log file 
  * Should have a specalised file extension 
  * With shortcuts for that file - effectively a version of todo.txt but with more going on. 
  * so we can tick and whatever
  * And highlight 


## Questions to answer 
* Do we mark off 'if' checks we've done? If the object is to boost ticks then that's fine. 

## Key 

âœ“ done 
- ignore
3 done three times 
* Needs to be changed, don't count. 

For each day, count the terms.
