_So, you are sad_ 

We don't know in advance how sad you are. This might be easily fixable and it might be long-term fixable, but it is fixable.  


* First, we're going to make sure that physically we are on the right page. 
  * 1L water (sad people take on a lot of carbs and little water, let's flush the system and get a big poo started)  
* Next, remember these things
  * Honesty. 
    * All stress comes from a lie. 
    * But, under stress people make things up. 
* Positivity exercises: 
  * 20 good things that have happened recently. 
  * Deep breath. 
  * (you won't want to do this before the 20 things) Now, How is this feeling a gift? 
* Try working again for 1 hour.  <!-- I didn't do that for the mental health day --> 
* If still sad. 
  * Tell people.
    * Message a couple of friends first  
    * Put a message on social media.  Which should be at this point "I'm having an emotional day and am finding it hard to concentrate". Tell people soon so it's NOT a surprise if you need/want support later. 
  * Brainstorm possible causes:
    * Who are you angry at? 
    * Where is the lie? 
  * Try working for 1 hour
  * If still sad. 
      * Get in car. Go and buy pens and paper and then go to a coffee shop. Put everything down on the page.
