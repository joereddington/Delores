# Picking an item
* If there are >5 of the current priority level, then sort on due date (for (A) or (C)) or importance (B) and (D) or pick at random (E)  

# Item in todo list. 
* Vim tasks go into the vim issue! 
* Check priority
  * If priority changes then sort and start again. 
  * If priority implies a date and person, then fill those in. 
* If will take over an hour:  
  * It should be an github issue. Or at least treated as one.  
  * then list six steps in the stack 
  * If can go live, then go live 
* If 'I can't do this now' - write a proper note and see what prep work you can do, draft email, pack bag 
  * When done, rewrite the issue so that the next action is clear and the description is up to date.
