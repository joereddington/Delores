# Main thing
Always go back to inbox.md. Rewrite, make notes and break down, that's the prupose of it. 


# Item in todo list. 
* Get excited.  
  * Really think about what it will be like to get it finally ticked off. 
* Vim tasks go into the vim issue! Delores tasks go in the delores todo. 
* Read the github issue 
* If you'll ever do this task again:
  * Make good notes
* If will take over an hour:  
  * It should be an github issue. Or at least treated as one.  
  * If it is already a github issue, then you should read the issue before you start
  * then list six steps in the stack 
  * If can go live, then go live 
* If 'I can't do this now' - write a proper note and see what prep work you can do, draft email, pack bag 
  * When done, rewrite the issue so that the next action is clear and the description is up to date. 
* Do the first step in the stack 
  * If the task ends up taking long than an hour, convert to github or blog 
  * Remember that, by definition, this task is more important than anything below it. 
  * It's done when there is nothing left to do - it's done when you need things from other people to keep doing  

* When it's done, return to the last page.

# Mapping 
* Map in Vim first. 
* Make a list of all the information you have. 
* Make a list of the steps that you need to carry out
