title: But I don't want to
--- 


_So, there's a task at the top of the list that you don't want to do_

Good, that means it's important. There's an emotional reason you don't want to do it. 
Start by writing down the first physical action, something that takes less than 60 seconds at most. 

Commit to 60 seconds. 

THERE MUST BE A PATH OUT OF THIS

We don't know in advance how sad you are. This might be easily fixable and it might be long-term fixable, but it is fixable.  


* First, we're going to make sure that physically we are on the right page. 
  * 1L water (sad people take on a lot of carbs and little water, let's flush the system and get a big poo started)  
* Positivity exercises: 
  * 20 good things that have happened recently. 
  * Deep breath. 
  * (you won't want to do this before the 20 things) Now, How is this feeling a gift? 
* Try working again for 1 hour. 
* If still sad. 
  * Tell people. Announce the current state of yourself. Which should be at this point "I'm having an emotional day and am finding it hard to concentrate". Tell people soon so it's NOT a surprise if you need/want support later. Use the positivity exercise in the previous step to make it a gratitude post. 
* Brainstorm possible causes:
  * Who are you angry at? 
  * Where is the lie? 

* Get in car. Go and buy pens and paper and then go to a coffee shop. Put everything down on the page.  

* Honesty. 
  * All stress comes from a lie. 
  * But, under stress people make things up.
