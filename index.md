Some things that are worth knowing about Delores: 

Sometimes it's useful to follow the page step by step, but a lot of the time 90% of the value is found by writing it out once so that you spot those times you are lying to yourself. 

## Morning 
* clean teeth and process clear bags
* Running clothes
* Check dishwasher has been on
* drink 1l water
* Vitamin tablet
* Put kettle on 


# Getting into a good mood 
* Fill out big book of gratitude
* Smile
* Visualise 
* Write down what you are scared about *and* what you are excited about. 

# Make sure we'll still have energy in a few hours. 
* Fill out the daily checklist (As a reminder of the things you want to do well) 
* Get glasses
* [Plan Time and Process Calendar](process_calendar) (Includes planning exercise and food) <!--Because something might be urgent --> 
* Get full water bottle, hot drink, and tray (take dirty cups out with you) 


# Defensive Focus  
* Phone is literally locked away (if you need a code for a login, then you can wait, if you need to make a call, use Skype).
* Turn on redirector (consider opening social media stack).
* Commit to work in vim. 

## Work day
* Work out how long the sprint is going to be and set alarm  (ten minutes early if tagging in on kids)  - respond to alarms not clocks 
* Collect any tasks
  * Process reminders
  * Clear desk into inbox. 
  * [Process Inbox](process_inbox)
  * Process Paper (which should be in inbox anyway)
  * Empty recycle bin (Shift-CMD-Backspace) then: process/Delete files in filesystem 
* Process inbox.md
  * Remember the purpose of the file: 
    * To help you recover from interupts 
    * To make notes that might be useful 
    * To track time
    * To produce blog posts
  * Turn Stack into todos 
  * Write up sections properly.
    * Move relevant sections over to their own issue
  * For previous days: review, check, and move everything over to index.md
  * Run the deploy script  (~/git/joereddington.github.io/diary/scripts/deploy.sh)
  * Close open windows 
  * (If Monday) Look at the automatic calendar and *Write down* a review of the previous week
* Make sure you know what you 'big thing' for the week is. 
* If workday: open eqt.todo.txt else: open todo.txt
* While there are items on the list 
  * [Attack first item on list](listitem)
  * literal rest
